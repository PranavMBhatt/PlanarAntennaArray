# PlanarAntennaArray
Here's a Python code to find individual element phase shift values from input Beam scan/steering angles (SteeringAngleTheta & SteeringAnglePhi) for Planar Antenna arrays of arbitrary sizes (M x N).
User inputs are: 1. The size of Array, i.e., Number of Elements (M x N) (M_max, N_max) in integers
                 2. Steering/Scan Angles (SteeringAngleTheta, SteeringAnglePhi) in degrees
                 3. Uniform distances between the elements in x and y direction (dx, dy) in meters
                 4. Frequency of Operation (frequency) in Hz

Give it a try. Thanks!!
